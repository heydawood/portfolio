## What is NextJs?

NextJs is a React framework that allows you to build server-rendered React
applications with ease. It provides a number of features out of the box, such as
server-side rendering, static site generation, and API routes, that make it easy
to build fast and scalable React applications.

  return <h1>Hello, NextJs!</h1>
}
```

## Why use NextJs?

NextJs is a great choice for building server-rendered React applications because
it provides a number of features that make it easy to build fast and scalable
applications. Some of the key features of NextJs include:

- Server-side rendering: NextJs allows you to render your React components on
  the server, which can improve performance and SEO.
- Static site generation: NextJs can generate static HTML files for your pages
  at build time, which can improve performance and reduce hosting costs.
- API routes: NextJs allows you to create API routes that can be used to fetch
  data from external APIs or perform server-side logic.

## How to use NextJs

To use NextJs, you need to create a new NextJs project by running the following
command:

```bash
npx create-next-app my-app
```

This will create a new NextJs project in a directory called `my-app`. You can
then navigate to the project directory and start the development server by
running the following command:

```bash
cd my-app
npm run dev
```

This will start the development server and open your NextJs application in your
browser. You can then start building your application by creating new pages,
components, and API routes.
