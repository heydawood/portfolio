MDX is a powerful tool that allows you to write JSX in your Markdown files. This
post will introduce you to the basics of MDX.

## What is MDX?

MDX is a file format that allows you to write JSX in your Markdown files. This
means that you can use React components, import other components, and even write
inline JSX in your Markdown files.

```
export async function getSource() {
  const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
  const data = await response.json();
  return data;
}
```

## Why use MDX?

MDX is a great way to write interactive documentation, blog posts, and other
content that requires more than just plain text. By using MDX, you can easily
embed interactive components, code snippets, and other dynamic content in your
Markdown files.

## How to use MDX

To use MDX, you need to install a plugin for your static site generator or build
tool. For example, if you're using Gatsby, you can use the `gatsby-plugin-mdx`
plugin to enable MDX support in your project.

Once you have the plugin installed, you can start writing MDX files by creating
files with the `.mdx` extension and writing JSX inside them.
